# My Thoughts:

News of the recent release of the reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 by Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has, at least for me, been all over every social media platform that I browse on a daily basis. The article linked above makes reference to certain benchmark tests that R1 supposedly outperforms on in comparison to OpenAI's o1 model, which is the that I have used the most, especially for certain personal projects / intellectual adventures. The benchmark tests that especially stand out to me are the ones relating to math: AIME and MATH-500, to be precise. The article also discusses other Chinese AI labs that are also developing models that hope to beat o1.

What especially interests me in this article is the discussion about the ability of the smallest "distillation" of the R1 model to run on a laptop, in addition to the drastically cheaper price of DeepSeek's API in comparison to that of o1. In my opinion, this progression in accessibility (in terms of price and hardware necessary to play around with the models) is a great advancement in the world's technology, and I hope that these new advancements will continue to be accessible to the general population moving forward.
